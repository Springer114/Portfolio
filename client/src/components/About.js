                        <p>I am a full stack software engineer with a desire for building, fixing, and improving. Previously, I worked as an electrician which helped fulfill my desire for building. My wife works as a developer and after experiencing that second hand, I knew I had found the career that I was looking for. It is an opportunity to merge both my enthusiasm for building as well as my excitement for technology. My goal in the tech industry is to find a niche where I can utilize all of these skills. I am motivated by the end userâ€™s experience and quality is my driving force.</p>
